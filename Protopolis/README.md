I'm using 'Make Your Own Python Text Adventure' by Philip Johnson as a guide.

the "speech" module is something not included in the guide that I wrote a long time ago.

8/4/2020:
Just added enemies.py. I'm struggling to implement speech.py. It seems I need to reformat the intro_text strings.
speech.py seems to mess up the formatting.

8/9/2020:
Added player combat and additional text to enemy tiles but some of the text does not seem to returning.
Should diagram the flow of the program. This feels like a mess.

Need to add "equip_weapon" command.
